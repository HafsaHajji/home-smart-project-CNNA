# Home Smart Project - CCNA

## Description
This project demonstrates a **Smart Home Network** simulation using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The objective is to create a connected home environment where IoT (Internet of Things) devices are integrated and controlled within a network.

## Environment Used
- **Software:** Cisco Packet Tracer
- **Network Protocols:** TCP/IP, MQTT
- **Devices:** Smart Home Devices, Routers, Switches, PCs, and Wireless Access Points
- **Topology:** Smart Home Network Simulation

## Features Implemented
- **IoT Device Integration:** Smart Lights, Smart Thermostat, Smart Door Lock, Motion Sensors
- **Network Connectivity:** Wireless and Wired Configurations
- **Remote Access:** IoT devices can be accessed via a PC or mobile interface
- **Security:** Basic network security configurations such as encryption and password protection

## Installation & Setup
1. **Install Cisco Packet Tracer**
   - Ensure that Cisco Packet Tracer is installed on your system.
   
2. **Open Project File**
   - Load the provided `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.

3. **Configure Network Devices**
   - Set up the IP addresses and connectivity for all devices.

4. **Test Device Communication**
   - Ping different devices to verify connectivity.
   - Control IoT devices using the Packet Tracer interface.

## How to Use
- Open Cisco Packet Tracer and load the project file.
- Use the **IoT Registration Server** to add and manage smart devices.
- Control smart home appliances remotely.
- Monitor device status and network performance.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement voice control using virtual assistants.
- Add firewall and advanced security settings.
- Expand the network to include more smart home components.
